# Changelog

## v1.3.0

### Focus Restoration (Issue #1 Fix)
- **Breaking behavioral change**: Click Run now restores focus to the previously active window after clicking buttons
- Prevents target applications (Kiro, VS Code, Claude) from stealing focus when buttons are clicked
- Uses Win32 `GetForegroundWindow` / `SetForegroundWindow` with thread input attachment for reliable focus restoration
- New config options:
  - `restoreFocusAfterClick` (default: `true`) — enables focus restoration
  - `focusRestoreDelayMs` (default: `50`) — delay before restoring focus to let target app process click
- Users can disable focus restoration by setting `"restoreFocusAfterClick": false` if needed for specific workflows

### Tray Menu Usability (Issue #2 Fix)
- Engine automatically pauses while tray menu is open, ensuring user can always interact with controls
- Tray tooltip now shows kill switch hotkey: "Click Run v1.3.0 — Running (Ctrl+Alt+R)"
- Previous pause state is preserved — if engine was paused before opening menu, it stays paused after closing

### Technical Changes
- Added P/Invoke declarations for `GetForegroundWindow`, `SetForegroundWindow`, `AttachThreadInput`, `GetWindowThreadProcessId`, `GetCurrentThreadId` to `Clicker.cs`
- Extended `IClickExecutor.Click()` signature with `restoreFocus` and `focusRestoreDelayMs` parameters
- Updated `AutomationClickExecutor` and `TrustFallbackHandler` to pass focus restoration parameters
- Added `menu.Opening` / `menu.Closed` event handlers in `TrayApp.cs` for pause-on-menu-open behavior
- Updated documentation in `configuration.md` and `README.md`

## v1.2.0

### Trust Dialog Fallback
- New opt-in fallback for blocking trust dialogs where no execution buttons exist
- Detects when Kiro shows only trust-level options ("Full command", "Base", "Partial") without "Accept" or "Run"
- When `trustFallbackMode: "safe"` is enabled, clicks only "Full command ..." (narrowest trust scope)
- Never clicks "Base", "Partial", or broad trust options
- 6 independent safety checks: mode gate, blocking detection, descriptor validation, process whitelist, execution label guard, debounce

### IClickExecutor Abstraction
- Extracted click execution behind `IClickExecutor` interface
- Production uses `AutomationClickExecutor` (real UI Automation)
- Tests use `MockClickExecutor` for full end-to-end pipeline testing without COM dependencies

### Strict Config Parsing
- Custom `StrictTrustFallbackModeConverter` for `trustFallbackMode` — accepts only `"off"` or `"safe"` (case-sensitive)
- Rejects numeric values, PascalCase, and any non-string input
- Invalid config values cause startup failure with clear error message

### Trust Label Word Boundary Matching
- Trust label detection uses word-boundary prefix matching
- "Base python" matches, "Baseball" does not
- "Partial python" matches, "Partially complete" does not

### Debounce Hash Collision Fix
- Replaced pipe-delimited hash format with length-prefixed encoding
- Prevents hash collisions when field values contain the delimiter character

### Safety Hardening
- Process whitelist check is case-sensitive for trust fallback (stricter than normal flow)
- Wildcard `"*"` process entries explicitly excluded from trust fallback
- Descriptor validation requires match in scan result (ProcessName + ButtonLabel + AutomationId)
- ScanHash verification ensures detection results came from the real detector
- Null whitelist guard throws immediately instead of silently proceeding

### New Config Option
- `trustFallbackMode`: `"off"` (default) or `"safe"` — controls trust dialog fallback behavior
- See `docs/configuration.md` for full documentation

## v1.1.2

### Faster Prompt Handling
- Reduced first-seen delay from 2000ms to 500ms — prompts now handled in ~1 second
- Trust variation dialogs ("Full command" / "Base") auto-clicked almost instantly

### Version Tracking
- Added version info to executable (File Properties → Details shows 1.1.2)
- Installer now reflects correct version number
- GitHub URL updated in installer

## v1.1.1

### Context-Aware "Yes" Clicking
- "Yes" buttons require context validation — checks dialog text for safe/dangerous keywords
- Extracts text from UI tree around buttons (not just window title)
- Safe: "Allow write", "Permission", "Grant", "Make this edit"
- Dangerous: "Delete", "Remove", "Overwrite" — hard reject

### Keyboard Fallback
- For Electron/webview panels where UI Automation can't click
- Detects numbered options ("1 Yes", "2 No"), sends key via SendInput
- Window focus management via SetForegroundWindow + AttachThreadInput

### Prefix Match for Dynamic Labels
- Handles Kiro's "Trust command" dialog with dynamic button labels
- "Full command python -m ..." matches via prefix

### First-Seen Delay
- Waits before clicking newly detected buttons to prevent premature clicks

### Performance Fix
- Fixed ContextExtractor walking entire Electron window tree (289K chars, 7s/cycle)
- Capped at 500 chars, max depth 3 — scan cycles back to ~1 second

## v1.1.0

### System Tray App
- Converted from CLI to Windows tray application (WinExe, no console window)
- NotifyIcon with context menu: Running/Paused status, Pause/Resume, Open Logs, Open Config, Start with Windows, Exit
- Double-click tray icon to toggle pause/resume
- Auto-start on Windows login via registry (HKCU\...\Run)
- Single-instance guard via named Mutex

### Multi-Window Mode
- Scan all visible windows belonging to whitelisted processes (not just foreground)
- Catches permission prompts in background Kiro/VS Code windows
- Enable via `"multiWindowMode": true`

### Context-Aware "Yes" Clicking
- "Yes" buttons require context validation before clicking
- Extracts text from the UI tree around the button (dialog container, siblings)
- Safe keywords: "Allow write", "Permission", "Grant", "Make this edit", etc.
- Dangerous keywords: "Delete", "Remove", "Overwrite", etc. — hard reject
- Configurable via `contextRequiredLabels`, `safeContextKeywords`, `dangerousContextKeywords`

### Keyboard Fallback
- For Electron/webview panels where UI Automation can't click buttons
- Detects numbered options ("1 Yes", "2 No") in context text
- Focuses target window via SetForegroundWindow + AttachThreadInput
- Sends key via SendInput with proper timing delays
- Enable via `"enableKeyboardFallback": true`

### Keyword Priority
- Whitelist label order defines strict priority: Run > Allow > Accept > Trust
- "Trust command and accept" resolves to Accept (index 5) not Trust (index 8)

### Performance Fix
- Fixed ContextExtractor walking entire Electron window tree (289K chars, 7s per cycle)
- Now capped at 500 chars, max depth 3, only small containers (Group/Custom)
- Scan cycles back to ~1 second

### Installer
- Inno Setup installer (ClickRunSetup.exe)
- Installs to Program Files, Start Menu shortcut, optional desktop shortcut
- Optional auto-start on Windows startup
- Clean uninstall

## v1.0.0

Initial release. CLI-based auto-clicker for AI tool permission prompts using Windows UI Automation API.
